========================================

Please note at the top of the bill header you had the master bill listed twice.  I've removed the one in the house bill field and retransmitted.  Please check to make sure that it goes through.

Dear Tracy,

We filed the ISF for HBL number but received a rejection status stating "DUPLICATE BILL OF LADING ISF REJECTED."

According to the shipper, the ISF for this shipment was only filed by the Intoglo team.

Could you please check on your end and confirm whether the ISF has already been filed?
